# Nash's Gore Mod: Vengeance Edition
Version: 1.0<br/>
Requires: GZDoom 4.1.3 or higher<br/>
Official forum thread: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=62641<br/>
Github: https://github.com/nashmuhandes/nashgore<br/>

### Load Order

Please load nashgore.pk3 last (or fairly late) in your load order, to ensure
that no other mod overrides NGM's content.

### Options

Most of the effects in Nash's Gore Mod can be customized. Please visit
the Options menu for more details.

### Special Lump: BLUDTYPE

Nash's Gore Mod introduces a new special lump called BLUDTYPE. You can simply
create a BLUDTYPE.txt and load it after NGM; the lumps will stack.

For example: gzdoom.exe -file nashgore.pk3 bludtype.txt

The BLUDTYPE lump is used to list blood actor classes to override. For
example, Smooth Doom changes the Cacodemon blood type to "Blueblood", which
causes NGM's blood to never appear. To fix that, simply add "BlueBlood"
on a new line into BLUDTYPE.txt.

USAGE: Simply list down blood Actor classes you wish to override, each on a
new line.

A sample BLUDTYPE.txt for Smooth Doom:

```
XBlood
BlueBlood
GreenBlood
```
